# Single runs

A _"single"_ run, is one in which a single version of code is being tested. This is the simplest way to run a plan. If you have run through the the test plan writing tutorial, you have already encountered this.

```text
testground run single -p <plan> -t <testcase> -r <runner> -b <builder> -i <instances>
```

A single test run can be used to benchmark, validate, or observe the behaviors of a peer-to-peer system.
