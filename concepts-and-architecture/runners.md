description: What are Testground runners?

# Runners

A `runner` is system which executes a number of instances of plans which have previously been compiled by the Testground builder. Whereas the `builder` takes plan code as its input and produces the compiled unit of work as output, the work unit is executed by the `runner` with the right number of duplicates to generate the test output.
